The Ultimate Music Toy (UMT) is a music composition system that lets you interactively change the composition while it's playing, and immediately hear the results!

It runs in the web browser and is written entirely in Javascript and uses the WebAudio API in HTML5 to actually play the music.

Tested to work on Chrome but should work on any HTML5-compliant browser.
